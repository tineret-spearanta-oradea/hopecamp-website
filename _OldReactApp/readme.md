### Local developement setup

Ensure you have the latest branch commit by running:

```
git pull
```

Then install node packages:

```
npm i
```

Then run on local server using:

```
npm run dev
```

### Branching

When creating a new branch, make sure to create it _from_ latest `main` branch.

It's a good practice to keep your feature branch up-to-date with the main branch.

Before creating a PR, make sure your feature branch is up-to-date with the main branch, by merging main into feature branch or rebasing - whichever is more familiar to you.
